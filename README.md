# DSA in Java
The following repo consists of the basic DSA structures for almost all coding languages, but are coded in Java for the sake of easiness. It consists of programs of linear strucutres such as Static Array, Dynamic Array, Queue and Stacks, and non-linear Structures such as Hash Map/Table and Trees. The following also contains the major algorithms used throughout DSA.
